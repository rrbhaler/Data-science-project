# Data-science-project
This project aims at conducting research and analysis on p53 mutant dataset. p53, also known as TP53 or tumor protein is a gene that codes for a protein that regulates the cell cycle and hence functions as a tumor suppression. It is very important for cells in multicellular organisms to suppress cancer. Our Data Set contains Biophysical models of mutant p53 proteins yield features which can be used to predict p53 transcriptional activity. The goal is to model mutant p53 transcriptional activity (active vs inactive) based on data extracted from biophysical simulations.
